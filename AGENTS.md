Lanttern is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework for educational assessment and learning management.

## Project guidelines

- Run `mix credo --strict` and scoped tests when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues, and always ask the developer to run the broader `mix precommit` task to ensure everything is ok (and save some tokens)
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps
- Use Tidewave MCP for development tooling
- use `mix credo` (also included in `mix precommit`) for code quality
- use `mix sobelow` for security analysis when needed
- when requested to write commit messages, PR summaries, or PR reviews:
  - use markdown, and write it to a `_transfer.md` file, so we can simply copy and paste it in GitHub
  - for PRs, remember that we can see all code changes through diff in the PR UI, so focus on giving information about the context, changes made, expected impacts â€” the idea is that the summary can complement the code changes. you can still reference the relevant files if needed.
  - for PRs, do not include a test plan

## Testing

- When planning tests, focus on behavior (what) and not on implementation (how). For example: considering a form live component, we don't want to test the form in isolation, we want to test the user flow in the live view where this form is used
- Avoid unit testing every detail of a feature, and focus on main user workflows. It doesn't cost much to develop lots and lots of tests, but it may be costly to maintain them
- Prefer using pattern matching for assertions instead of checking with `length/1` and `hd/1`

### Front end tests

- When testing views, use `phoenix_test` (`conn |> visit("some/path") |> click_link...`). This is not the current project pattern because `phoenix_test` was implemented recently, but we want to use it as the default for front end tests from now on, and we will update old tests little by litte

### Test fixtures

- We are favoring `ExMachina` factories instead of default fixture functions.
- When creating new schemas use factories instead of Phoenix generators' fixtures, and when generating data for testing always prefer using factories, if available.
- Factories should `build` and `insert` only if needed. For example, if a factory of `A` belongs to `B`, the factory should have a `b = Map.get(attrs, :b, insert(:b))`, which is used in `a = %A{b: b}`. As this is not the default ExMachina behavior, we also need to manually handle merge and lazy evaluation. Putting it all together:

```elixir
 def a_factory(attrs) do
  b = Map.get(attrs, :b, build(:b))

  %A{b: b}
  |> merge_attributes(attrs)
  |> evaluate_lazy_attributes()
end
 ```

## Type spec

### Schema type `t()` spec

- Always include `| Ecto.Association.NotLoaded.t()` for preloaded structures
- Always include `| nil` for nullable fields

## PR size check

We should aim for PRs with a maximum of 500 loc (additions and deletions) considering only the `lib` folder.

It's important to periodically update the `main` branch, and check for size with `git diff --stat main lib`.

## Temporary guidelines

### Transition to Phoenix 1.8 scopes

The recent Phoenix framework release introduced [scopes](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/scopes.html) for enhanced security.

Currently, the structure we're using more or less like scope is the `current_user` (`%User{}`).
We will officialy migrate to scopes soon, but until that happens, we want the new context functions (e.g. CRUD) to
always include `current_user` as one of the params, so we can extract the user profile, school, and etc. for
access control.
